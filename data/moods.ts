      'There was a season in my life when joy felt elusive. I had tied my happiness to things like career success and relationships, which often left me feeling empty. One day, I stumbled upon Philippians 4:4, which challenged me to rejoice in the Lord always. Slowly, I started shifting my focus from my circumstances to God’s unchanging love. I began starting my mornings by thanking Him for the smallest blessings: the sunrise, the sound of birds, even the ability to breathe. Over time, His joy replaced my anxiety. I learned that true joy comes from trusting His promises and walking in His presence daily.',
